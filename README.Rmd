The goal of ShinyFriendlyCaptcha is to provide [Friendly Captcha](https://friendlycaptcha.com/) to Shiny apps.

## Features

Friendly Captcha is an European alternative to Google Recaptcha. It allow to protect websites against spam and bots in a privacy-embedded design.

Main features :

* Cryptographic bot protection
* No labeling tasks for users
* No tracking and cookies
* Fully accessible
* Guaranteed availability with SLA
* GDPR compliance agreements

## Installation

You can install the development version of ShinyFriendlyCaptcha from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mhanf/ShinyFriendlyCaptcha")
```
## Example 

In order to use the ShinyFriendlyCaptcha library, you’ll need to go to the Friendly Captcha [website](https://friendlycaptcha.com/) and subscribe a plan to generate valid `SITEKEY` and `SECRET` strings. A free plan is proposed to developers for non-commercial use (protection of 1 website with up to 1,000 requests/month). For more details go to their [website](https://friendlycaptcha.com/).

ShinyFriendlyCaptcha exports two main functions: `sfc_output()` and `sfc_server()`. A vignette is available [here]() to help in the proper setup of these functions. A Shiny app example using these functions can be created as follows:
